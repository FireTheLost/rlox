# rlox

This is an implementation of Lox from the book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom. It implements the bytecode version of Lox in Rust, hence the name rlox. I started this to further develop my Rust skills, and to set a foundation to make my own compiler.

## Skills I Learned/Improved Upon While Working On This Project
- Writing Rust code.
- Reading C code.
